            <p>
                The handstand push-up is a dynamic progression from the static handstand, requiring the practitioner to lower their head 
                toward the ground and push back up to a full handstand position. This movement dramatically increases the demand on 
                shoulder and triceps strength. Proper form involves maintaining a straight body line throughout the movement, controlling 
                the descent, and pressing through the palms to return to the top position. Wall-assisted variations are commonly used 
                for training and building strength.
