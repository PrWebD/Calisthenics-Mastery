                The 90° handstand push-up (also known as a bent-arm handstand or elbow lever push-up) is an extremely advanced variation 
                where the practitioner balances in a handstand with elbows bent at 90 degrees, then performs push-ups from this position. 
                This skill requires exceptional shoulder, triceps, and core strength, as well as precise balance control. The movement 
                path is much shorter than a full handstand push-up, but the static hold at 90 degrees places immense strain on the 
                supporting muscles. This skill bridges the gap between handstand and planche progressions.
