                The front lever is an advanced calisthenics skill performed on a pull-up bar where the body is held horizontal to the 
                ground with arms straight and palms facing the body. This static hold requires exceptional back, core, and grip strength. 
                The body forms a straight line from hands to feet, with shoulders in a depressed position. Progressions typically 
                start with tuck front lever, then advance to advanced tuck, straddle, and finally full front lever.
