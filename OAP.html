            <p>
                The one-arm planche is one of the most difficult calisthenics skills, representing the pinnacle of anterior strength 
                and body control. In this variation, the entire body is held parallel to the ground, supported by a single arm. 
                The demands on the supporting shoulder, chest, and core are extraordinary, requiring not only immense strength 
                but also perfect balance and anti-rotational control. The non-supporting arm is typically held against the torso 
                or extended for balance. This skill is extremely rare and represents years of dedicated training.
