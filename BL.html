            <p>
                The back lever is an intermediate-to-advanced calisthenics skill performed on a pull-up bar where the body is held 
                face-down and parallel to the ground with arms straight. This static hold requires good back, core, and shoulder 
                strength. The body forms a straight line from hands to feet, with shoulders in a protracted position. It's often 
                used as a progression toward more advanced skills like the iron cross or as a complementary exercise to the front lever.
